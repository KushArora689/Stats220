## Project requirements 

I am confident that I have met the requirements related to working with GitHub and GitHub pages, as I have created a repository called stats220 and in the repository I have edited the read.md file so it contains information about the purpose of my repository. Furthermore I have created a page for my index.html so it is live.

- [My repo](https://github.com/KushArora689/Stats220.git)
- [My website](https://kusharora689.github.io/Stats220/)

## How my project demonstrates creativity
In my explanations I have described the inspiration and sources of my meme. For my animation, I recreated a battle between two game character and explained in my explanations what happens in the fight between them.

Through the use of CSS I have made this website look much more beautiful.

- I have added borders to the images and curved them. 
- I have changed the Font color and Font type.
- I have changed the background color to a different color
- I have underlined the Sub-headings
- For the main heading I added a separate background color so it stands out 

## Learning reflection
Creating HTML pages through the use of R markdown I think is a very simple yet powerful way to create nice looking HTML pages. R markdown allows us to use it's simple syntax instead of HTML syntax which is a bit more complicated

In the future I am excited to hopefully explore to use R and R markdown to create much more complicated and meaningful websites. For example, a project can be a graph creator which takes a series of co-ordinates or an equation and creates a graph through that. I am also looking forward to learn more complicated concepts on R, R markdown and CSS.
```{css}
p {
font-weight: bold;
color: white;
}

img {
  border-radius: 8px;
  border: 5px solid white;
}
a{
font-weight: bold;
color: hotpink;
text-decoration: underline;
}

h1{
background-color: lightgrey;
padding: 15px;
border-radius: 20px;
}

h2{
text-decoration: underline;

}

body {
background-color: #24c5d4;
color: white;
font-family: Garamond, serif;
}

```
